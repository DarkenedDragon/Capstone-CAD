The tolerances on the lifting mechanism are way to tight
Is there space for a nut on the back of the arm plate?
How to attach the magnet? - screwed into the rack? 
The pinion is not really attached to the servo. Its shaft is ~1mm larger than the screw hole on the servo. May need to 3D print the pinion to match the servo's groves
The lever on the limit switches is slightly smaller than the ones in the lab. I'm not sure if the body is different, but the positioning should remain the same
The modeled servo is probably not the one we will end up using
Need to think about cable management. Could probably put a cable carrier on the top of the arm. Couldn't model it without straining my computer
The motor mounting plate on the arm may be replaced with the one in the lab. It's larger and thus has more space for adding counterweights
The piece lifiting mechanisim isn't very compliant
Limit switch is on the wrong side of the arm cart
Manufacturing the rack could be hard. I was thinking we'd need to mill out the channels, but I need to talk to the people in Lacy to see if that's doable.
